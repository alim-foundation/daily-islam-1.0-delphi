.Subject Holy Qur'an and Contemplation of the Universe
Verily We sent down to you clear signs, but none disbelieved in them except the perverse. --> Qur'an Translation 2:99
Whatever We abrogate of a sign or cause to be forgotten, We bring (in its place) one better than it or its peer. Do you not know that God has power over all things? --> Qur'an Translation 2:106
The month of Ramadan (is the month) in which the Qur'an was sent down (as) a guidance for mankind, a clear evidence of guidance, the criterion of right and wrong; so whosoever of you witnesses the month, he shall fast therein, and whosoever is ill or on a journey (he shall fast) the same number of other days. God desires ease for you, and He does not desire hardship for you, should you complete the (prescribed) number (of days), and that you may glorify God for guiding you, and that you may be thankful (to Him). --> Qur'an Translation 2:185
These are the signs of God; We recite them to you in truth, and God does not intend injustice to mankind. --> Qur'an Translation 3:108
O you to whom the Scripture has been given! Believe in what We have revealed confirming what is (already) with you, before We alter faces and turn them on their backs, or We curse them as We cursed the people of the Sabbath, and the Command of God is ever executed. --> Qur'an Translation 4:47
Do they not think carefully about the Qur'an? Had it been from any other than God, they would surely have found much discrepancy therein. --> Qur'an Translation 4:82
Had God's grace not been upon you nor His mercy, a party among them would certainly have resolved to lead you astray, but they shall only lead their own selves astray, and they shall not harm you in the least. God has revealed the Book to you and granted you wisdom, and taught you what you did not know, and great is God's grace upon you. --> Qur'an Translation 4:113
O you who believe! Believe in God, His Messenger, and the Book which He has revealed to His Prophet (Muhammad), and the Book which He revealed before (him). Whoever denies God and His angels and Books, His Messengers and the Last Day, he has indeed strayed off, far away (from the right path). --> Qur'an Translation 4:136
God Himself bears witness that whatever He has revealed to you (O Our Prophet Muhammad) He sent with His Knowledge; and the angels, too, bear witness, and God is sufficient as Witness. --> Qur'an Translation 4:166
Verily those who disbelieve and obstruct people from God's way have indeed strayed off far away (from the Right Path). --> Qur'an Translation 4:167
O mankind! Indeed an undeniable proof from your Lord has come to you, and We have revealed to you a manifest Light. --> Qur'an Translation 4:174
We have revealed to you (O Our Prophet Muhammad) the Book (Qur'an) with truth, confirming what is before it of the book and a guardian thereof; therefore, judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their (vain) desires, diverging from what has come to you of the truth. For each of you We appointed a law and a way. Had God desired, He would have made all of you a single community, but He wished (instead) to try you in what He has given you; therefore, compete excelling one another in goodness; to God alone is the return of all of you; it is then that He shall declare to you that wherein you differed. --> Qur'an Translation 5:48
The Jews say: "The hand of God is tied up." Be their hands tied up, and be they cursed for what they say; nay, His hands are wide outstretched; He expends as He pleases. What has been revealed to you from your Lord will certainly increase many of them in transgression and infidelity, and We have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till the Day of Resurrection; every time they kindle a fire for war, God extinguishes it, and they strive to spread mischief on earth, and God does not love mischief-makers. --> Qur'an Translation 5:64
Say: "What is the weightiest in testimony?" Say: "God is witness between me and you, and this Qur'an has been revealed to me that I may thereby warn you, and whomsoever it reaches. Do you really bear witness that there are other gods with God?" Say: "I bear no such witness!" Say: "Verily, He is the One God, and verily I am away from that which you associate with Him." --> Qur'an Translation 6:19
We have sent this blessed Book (Qur'an) confirming that which preceded it, so that you may warn (the people of) the mother-city (Mecca) and those around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are (constantly) guarding their prayers. --> Qur'an Translation 6:92
Thus do We explain the signs, so that they may say: "You have been taught" and that We may make it clear to people who know. --> Qur'an Translation 6:105
Indeed We have brought them a Book which We have explained with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for people who believe. --> Qur'an Translation 7:52
When you do not bring them a sign, they say: "Why don't you forge it?" Say: "Verily I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord; these are clear proofs from your Lord, a guidance and mercy for people who believe." --> Qur'an Translation 7:203
When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it and be attentive, perchance you may receive mercy. --> Qur'an Translation 7:204
This Qur'an is not to be forged by anyone besides God, but it is a confirmation of (the Scriptures) that went before it and (the clearest) explanation of the Book; there is no doubt therein, it is from the Lord of the Worlds. --> Qur'an Translation 10:37
Or do they say: "He (Prophet Muhammad) has forged it"? Say: "Bring then a sura it and call for (your aid) whomsoever you can besides God if you be truthful." --> Qur'an Translation 10:38
Say: "O people! Indeed the truth (Qur'an) has come to you from your Lord: therefore whosoever receives the guidance, he receives guidance for his own good; whosoever strays, most surely he strays to its detriment; I am not a custodian over you." --> Qur'an Translation 10:108
And (O Our Messenger Muhammad): Follow what is revealed to you and forbear till God grants (His) Judgment; He is the best of all judges. --> Qur'an Translation 10:109
This is a clear message for mankind, so that they may be warned thereby, so that they may know that He is the One God, and that men of understanding may take heed. --> Qur'an Translation 14:52
Verily, We have revealed the Reminder and indeed We will be its Guardian. --> Qur'an Translation 15:9
Indeed We have given you the seven much repeated (verses) and the Great Qur'an. --> Qur'an Translation 15:87
It is said to those who guard themselves against evil: "What is that which your Lord has revealed?" They say: "Good." There will be good in this world for those who do good, but indeed the abode of the hereafter is better, and excellent indeed is the abode of those who guard themselves (against evil). --> Qur'an Translation 16:30
(We sent them) with indisputable evidence and scriptures, and We revealed the Zikr (Qur'an) to you so that you might clarify to mankind what has been revealed to them, perhaps they will reflect. --> Qur'an Translation 16:44
We did not reveal the Book to you (O Our Prophet Muhammad) except that you may explain to them that about which they differ, and as a guidance and a mercy for those who believe. --> Qur'an Translation 16:64
One day, We shall raise a witness in every people from among themselves, and bring you (O Our Prophet Muhammad) as a witness over all, and We have revealed unto you the Book, explaining everything, a guidance, mercy, and glad tidings to those who submit themselves (to God). --> Qur'an Translation 16:89
When you recite the Qur'an, seek refuge with God against Satan the accursed. --> Qur'an Translation 16:98

.Subject Man's Birth and Death
(Remember) the Day when every soul finds present whatever it has wrought of good and whatever it has wrought of evil, it will wish that the interval between it and itself were wide. But God cautions you of Himself, and God is affectionate to His faithful servants. --> Qur'an Translation 3:30
It is not for any soul to die except by God's permission, (according to) the Book that fixes its term. He who desires his reward in this life, We give him thereof. And he who desires his reward in the Hereafter, We give him thereof. And soon shall We reward the grateful ones. --> Qur'an Translation 3:145
O you who believe! Do not be like the disbelievers who said of their brethren upon travelling throughout the world or engaged in fighting (in the way of God): "Had they been with us, they would not have died and would not have been slain," so that God may make this an intense regret in their hearts; and it is God Who gives life and causes death; and God beholds what you do. --> Qur'an Translation 3:156
Every person tastes death, and verily you shall be paid your recompenses in full on the Day of Resurrection. Whosoever is removed from the Fire and admitted into Paradise has indeed achieved his goal, and the life in this world is only a provision of vanity. --> Qur'an Translation 3:185
O men! Reverence your Lord Who created you from a single person and created from him his mate, and spread from these two a multitude of men and women, and be heedful before God in Whose Name you importune one another, and be mindful of kinship; indeed God is Vigilant over you. --> Qur'an Translation 4:1
If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden, We will remit from you your misdeeds, and We will admit you into Paradise, an honourable place it is indeed. --> Qur'an Translation 4:31

Wherever you are, death will claim you, even if you are in lofty towers. If good befalls them they say: "This is from God," but if evil befalls them they say: "This is from you." Say, (O Our Prophet Muhammad): "All is from God." But what has happened to these people that they make practically no effort to understand anything they are told? --> Qur'an Translation 4:78

He it is Who created you of clay, then decreed the term (of your life); and a determined term is with Him, yet you doubt thereof. --> Qur'an Translation 6:2
Say: "To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "To God; He has prescribed mercy on Himself; most certainly He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection, there is no doubt about it; as for those who have ruined their souls, they will never believe." --> Qur'an Translation 6:12
He is the all-Dominant above His servants, and He sends guardians over you. When death comes to one of you, Our messengers (angels) take him away, and they never fail (in their duty). --> Qur'an Translation 6:61
Say: "My Lord has enjoined justice and set your faces upright when prostrating. Call upon Him sincerely, turning to Him exclusively in religion, even as He brought you forth in the beginning, so to Him shall you also return." --> Qur'an Translation 7:29
Those who reject Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter, vain shall be their deeds; shall they be recompensed save for what they have wrought? --> Qur'an Translation 7:147

Every soul shall taste death; then to Us will you all be returned. --> Qur'an Translation 29:57
God originates the creation, then He causes it to recur, then to Him shall you all be returned. --> Qur'an Translation 30:11

Say: "Who is he that can screen you from God if He intends to harm you, or to be merciful unto you?" And they will find for themselves no other guardian or helper besides God. --> Qur'an Translation 33:16
God takes the souls away at death. Those that do not die (He takes) during their sleep; God withholds (the life of) those on whom He has passed the decree of death; but He sends the others (to their bodies) till a fixed time.

Indeed the provision of the life of this world compared to the hereafter is but a trifling. --> Qur'an Translation 9:38

We make no distinction between one and another of them, and to Him alone have we submitted ourselves." --> Qur'an Translation 2:136
Thus have We made you a middle people, that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Prophet a witness over you. We did not fix the qibla towards which you faced except to distinguish him who follows the Prophet, from him who turns upon his heels. This was surely a hard thing for any except those whom God has guided. God would not render your faith in Him futile; verily God is Affectionate and Merciful to mankind. --> Qur'an Translation 2:143
We have sent you a Prophet from amongst your own selves who recites to you Our signs, purifies you, teaches you the Book and the wisdom, and teaches you that which you did not know, --> Qur'an Translation 2:151

Had God willed, those who came after them would not have fought among themselves after clear proofs had come to them, but they differed, and of them there were some who believed and some who disbelieved. Had God so willed, they would not have fought among themselves, but God does whatever He pleases. --> Qur'an Translation 2:253

No mark of travel was visible on him, and none of us recognized him. Sitting down beside Rasulullah (PBUH) touching his knees against his, and placing his hands on his thighs, he said, "Tell me, Muhammad (PBUH) about Islam." He replied: Islam means that you should bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger, that you should do the Salat, pay the Zakat, fast during Ramadan, and preform Hajj to the House (of Allah) if you have the means to go. The man said, "You have spoken the truth." We were astonished at his questioning and then declaring that he spoke the truth. He said, "Now tell me about Iman." Rasulullah (PBUH) replied: It means that you should believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, and that you should believe in the decreeing of both good and evil. The man said,"You have spoken the
